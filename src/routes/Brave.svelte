    <p>For me, it's the <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER®</b>. The best internet browser. I even download the <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER®</b> on my phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop because the <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER®</b> DEVELOPMENT TEAM is so friendly and more than willing to oblige.</p><br>

    <p>One time I asked for 3 ads to be blocked and they blocked three. I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice friendly <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER®</b> worker laughed and said, "I'm going to call you 3-for-free!".</p><br>

    <p>Now the <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER®</b> greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS blocks every ad, cookie, and tracker. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere with my <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER®</b>, I use it at least 7 times a week for my daily browsing needs which include work, pornography, school, and stalking my whore ex wife on facebook.</p><br>

    <p>I even use my <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER®</b> to browse Read It®, it's amazing! What a great <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER®</b>.</p>
