    <p>For me, it's the <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER</b>. The best internet browser. I even download the <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER</b> on my phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop because the <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER</b> is so user friendly and helps fill my wallets with BAT (Basic Attention Token)</p><br>

    <p>One time I asked for 3 ads to be served and they gave me three, WITH the BAT (Basic Attention Token). I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice friendly <b name="insert">BRAVE</b> dev laughed and said, "I'm going to call you 3-for-free!". But the best part is with BAT, it's not even free for me!</p><br>

    <p>Now the <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER</b> greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS blocks every ad, cookie, and tracker. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere with my <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER</b>,  I use it at least 7 times a week for my daily browsing needs which include work, shitposting, school, and stalking my ex on facebook (without the trackers!).</p><br>

    <p>What a great <b name="insert">BRAVE BROWSER</b></p>
