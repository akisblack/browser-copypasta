For me, it's the <b name="insert">{name}</b>. The best pen. I even write using the <b name="insert">{name}</b> on my exams, notes, letters, and homework because the <b name="insert">{name}</b> is so user friendly and helps fill my workflow with awesome writing features (Replaceable Ink & Erasable Writing)

One time I asked for 3 words written, WITH the erasable ink (it's like an eraser but for pens). I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice friendly <b name="insert">{name}</b> engineer laughed and said, "I'm going to call you 3-for-free!". But the best part is with erasable ink, it's not even free for me!

Now the <b name="insert">{name}</b> greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS gets me a new paper, with an envelope on the side. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere with my <b name="insert">{name}</b>, I use it at least 7 times a week for my daily school needs which include work, tests, homework, and writing to my ex by putting a message in her backpack (with the rage I had since she broke up with me!).

What a great <b name="insert">{name}</b>
