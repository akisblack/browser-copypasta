For me, it's the <b name="insert">{name}</b>. The best internet browser. I even download the <b name="insert">{name}</b> on my phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop because the <b name="insert">{name}</b> is so un-user friendly and helps fill my workflow with UUIDAF (Useless Updates I Didn't Ask For)

One time I asked for 3 UUIDAF to be served and they gave me three, WITH the PDC (Profile Data Corruption). I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice friendly <b name="insert">{name}</b> dev laughed and said, "I'm going to call you 3-for-free!". But the best part is with PDC, it's not even free for me!

Now the <b name="insert">{name}</b> greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS blocks every about:config change, chromium user, and facebook tracker. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere with my <b name="insert">{name}</b>, I use it at least 7 times a week for my daily browsing needs which include non-work, shitposting, watching femboy porn, and stalking my ex on facebook (without the facebook trackers!).

What a great <b name="insert">{name}</b>
