For me, it's the <b name="insert">{name}</b>. The best internet browser. I even download the <b name="insert">{name}</b> on my wii, wii mini and wii rvl-101 because the <b name="insert">{name}</b> is so exploited and helps me hack my wii with amazing exploits (flashax)

One time I asked for 3 crashes, WITH the wii turning off (the wii commits kms). I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice friendly <b name="insert">{name}</b> dev laughed and said, "I'm going to call you 3-for-free!". But the best part is with crashing, it's not even free for me!

Now the <b name="insert">{name}</b> greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS gets me a crash, with an opera error message on the side. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere with my <b name="insert">{name}</b>, I use it at least 1 times a year for my daily browsing needs which include emails, laughing at opera, flashhax, and stalking my ex on facebook (with her instagram tiled to the side!).

What a great <b name="insert">{name}</b>
