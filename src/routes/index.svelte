For me, it's the {@html browserNameHTML}. The best internet browser. I even download the {@html browserNameHTML} on my phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop because the {@html browserNameHTML} is so user friendly and helps fill my workflow with awesome tab features (Tab Stacks & Tab Tilling)
    
One time I asked for 3 tab stacks, WITH the tab tilling (multiple sites open at once on a screen). I said, "Wow, three for free!" and the nice friendly {@html browserNameHTML} dev laughed and said, "I'm going to call you 3-for-free!". But the best part is with tab tilling, it's not even free for me!
    
Now the {@html browserNameHTML} greets me with "hey it's 3-for-free!" and ALWAYS gets me a tab stack, with a web panel on the side. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere with my {@html browserNameHTML}, I use it at least 7 times a week for my daily browsing needs which include work, shitposting, school, and stalking my ex on facebook (with her instagram tiled to the side!).
    
What a great {@html browserNameHTML}
